# Privacy Policy

## Our Commitment to Privacy

Sposiv is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the Sposiv mobile application ("App") handles your information.

### Key Principle
**Sposiv is designed with privacy by design. All your data stays on your device.**

## What Data We Collect

### Information Stored Locally on Your Device

Sposiv stores the following information locally on your device:

• **Location Data**: GPS coordinates of spots you save  
• **Spot Information**: Names, addresses, notes, and ratings you add to saved locations  
• **Categories**: Custom categories and organizational preferences you create  
• **App Preferences**: Settings and configuration choices within the App

### What We Do NOT Collect

• We do not create user accounts or profiles  
• We do not collect personal identification information  
• We do not track your browsing habits or app usage patterns  
• We do not collect device identifiers for tracking purposes  
• We do not access your contacts, messages, or other apps data

## How We Use Your Information

### Local Processing Only

All information processing occurs locally on your device to:

• Display your saved spots on the map  
• Organize and categorize your locations  
• Provide search and filtering capabilities  
• Enable the sharing extension functionality

### No Server Transmission

Your personal data is never transmitted to our servers or any third-party services. Everything remains on your device under your direct control.

## Location Services

### Location Permission

Sposiv requests access to your device's location services for the following purposes:

• **Current Location Display**: Show your current position on the map  
• **Spot Saving**: Help you save locations near where you are  
• **Navigation**: Provide location context when using the App

### Location Data Handling

• Location data is processed in real-time and stored locally only when you explicitly save a spot  
• We do not track your location in the background  
• We do not create location history or movement patterns  
• You can disable location services for Sposiv at any time through your device settings

---

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage

All your data is stored locally on your device using:

• iOS Core Data framework for secure local database management  
• iOS Keychain for sensitive information (if applicable)  
• Standard iOS security measures provided by Apple

### Data Security

• Your data is protected by your device's built-in security features  
• We recommend keeping your device updated and using device lock features  
• Data is only accessible through the Sposiv app on your device

---

## Data Sharing and Third Parties

### No Data Sharing

Since all data remains local to your device, we do not share any personal information with third parties.

### Third-Party Services

The App may use the following third-party services that have their own privacy policies:

• **Apple Maps**: For map display and location search functionality  
• **iOS Location Services**: For accessing device location capabilities

We recommend reviewing Apple's privacy policy for information about how these services handle data.

---

## Your Privacy Rights

### Data Control

You have complete control over your data:

• **Access**: All your data is accessible within the App  
• **Modification**: You can edit or update any saved information  
• **Deletion**: You can delete individual spots or all data at any time  
• **Export**: You can back up your data through iOS backup features

### Data Portability

Your data can be included in iOS device backups and restored to new devices through standard iOS backup and restore processes.

## Children's Privacy

Sposiv does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Since all data processing occurs locally on the device, parents have direct control over any information their children might store in the App.

---

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by:

• Posting the new Privacy Policy within the App  
• Updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy

Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.
