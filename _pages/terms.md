## Agreement to terms

By downloading, installing, or using the Sposiv mobile application (the "App") operated by Brianna Honeywell ("Sposiv," "we," "us," or "our"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree with these Terms, do not download or use the App.

## Service description

Sposiv is a personal location bookmarking app that allows you to save, organize, and revisit your favorite places. The App is designed to help you keep track of locations that are important to you.

### Core features

- Save location bookmarks with personal notes
- Organize spots into custom lists
- Add photos to your bookmarked locations
- Search and filter your saved spots
- Export your data at any time

All data is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers or any third parties.

## Your responsibilities

### Accurate information

You are responsible for entering accurate location information into the App. While the App helps you organize and manage your saved spots, you are responsible for verifying the accuracy of all location data and descriptions you add.

### Data backup

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you are responsible for backing up your data through iOS device backups or other methods. We are not responsible for data loss due to device failure, accidental deletion, or other causes.

### Device security

You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device. Since the App stores data locally, ensure your device is properly secured with appropriate passwords, biometric locks, or other security measures.

### Respect for private property

When saving and visiting locations, you are responsible for respecting private property, local laws, and regulations. Do not save or promote access to locations where entry is prohibited or restricted.

## Prohibited uses

You agree not to use the App:

- For any illegal or unauthorized purpose
- To violate any international, federal, state, or local regulations or laws
- To attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the App
- To transmit any malicious code or attempt to compromise the App’s security
- For commercial purposes without our written consent
- To save locations that promote trespassing or illegal activities
- To infringe upon the privacy or property rights of others

## Intellectual property

The App, including its design, code, graphics, interface, and content, is owned by us and protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws. You are granted a limited, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable license to use the App for personal, non‑commercial purposes.

Your location data and content that you input into the App remains your property. We do not claim any ownership rights to your personal location information or saved spots.

## Disclaimers and limitations

### App availability

We strive to keep the App available and functional, but we cannot guarantee uninterrupted service. The App may be temporarily unavailable due to maintenance, updates, or factors beyond our control.

### Accuracy of location data

While we strive for accuracy in location features, we cannot guarantee that all location data is completely accurate or up to date. Location information is provided by third‑party mapping services and may be incorrect, outdated, or incomplete. You should verify important location information independently.

### Third‑party content

The App uses Apple Maps and other third‑party services for location data. We do not endorse or control these third parties and are not responsible for their content, accuracy, or privacy practices.

## Disclaimer

THE APP IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE APP WILL BE AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IN CONNECTION WITH THE APP AND YOUR USE THEREOF, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT. WE MAKE NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE APP’S CONTENT OR THE CONTENT OF ANY WEBSITES OR MOBILE APPLICATIONS LINKED TO THE APP AND WE WILL ASSUME NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY (1) ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR INACCURACIES OF CONTENT AND MATERIALS, (2) PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE, OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER, RESULTING FROM YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE APP, (3) ANY INTERRUPTION OR CESSATION OF TRANSMISSION TO OR FROM THE APP, (4) ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES, OR THE LIKE WHICH MAY BE TRANSMITTED TO OR THROUGH THE APP BY ANY THIRD PARTY, AND/OR (5) ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN ANY CONTENT AND MATERIALS OR FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF ANY CONTENT POSTED, TRANSMITTED, OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE VIA THE APP.

## Limitations of liability

IN NO EVENT WILL WE OR OUR DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, OR AGENTS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFIT, LOST REVENUE, LOSS OF DATA, OR OTHER DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, OUR LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION WILL AT ALL TIMES BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID, IF ANY, BY YOU TO US. CERTAIN U.S. STATE LAWS AND INTERNATIONAL LAWS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.

## App updates and changes

We may update the App from time to time to add features, fix bugs, or improve performance. Updates may be delivered automatically through the App Store or may require manual installation.

We reserve the right to modify the App or these Terms at any time. We will make reasonable efforts to notify users of significant changes through App Store updates or in‑app notifications. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the modified Terms.

## Termination

You may stop using the App at any time by deleting it from your device. These Terms will continue to apply to your past use of the App.

We may terminate your license to use the App if you violate these Terms, though given the local‑only nature of the App, such termination would primarily involve removal from the App Store.

## Governing law

These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States, without regard to conflict‑of‑law principles. Any disputes arising from these Terms or your use of the App will be subject to the jurisdiction of the appropriate courts.

## Changes to terms

We may modify these Terms at any time. When we do, we will post the updated Terms within the App and update the "Last updated" date. If we make significant changes, we may also notify users through the App Store update mechanism. Your continued use of the App after changes to these Terms constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.

## Contact information

If you have questions about these Terms, you can contact us through the support channels listed in the App or through the App Store review system.
